          Like the technical community as a whole, the Ruby for Good team and
          community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from
          all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission, including
          mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to
          communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few
          ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they’re
          participating within this community and its project. These rules apply
          equally to founders, mentors, and those seeking help and guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather,
          take it in the spirit in which it is intended—a guide to make it
          easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
          participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Ruby for
          Good team, including the venue. This includes IRC, Slack, the mailing
          lists, the issue tracker, Ruby for Good events, and any other forums
          created by the project team which the community uses for
          communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be welcoming, friendly, and patient. Be considerate. Your work will be
          used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of
          others. Any decision you take will effect users and colleagues, and
          you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
          Remember that we’re a worldwide community, so you might not be
          communicating in someone else’s primary language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
          is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
          experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
          frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember
          that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not
          a productive one. Members of the Ruby for Good community should be
          respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people
          outside of our communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of
          professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to
          others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and
          other exclusionary behaviors are not acceptable. This includes, but is
          not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul class="coc">
          <li class="coc">
            Violent threats or language directed against another person.
          </li>
          <li class="coc">
            Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
          </li>
          <li class="coc">Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
          <li class="coc">
            Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally
            identifying information (a.k.a. “doxing”).
          </li>
          <li class="coc">
            Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
          </li>
          <li class="coc">Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
          <li class="coc">
            Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
          </li>
          <li class="coc">
            Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
            stop, then stop.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social
          and technical, happen all the time and Ruby is no exception. It is
          important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
          constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Ruby
          comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of
          backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues.
          Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
          that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming
          each other doesn’t get us anywhere; rather offer to help resolve
          issues and learn from mistakes.
        </p>

          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may
          take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
          or expulsion from the event with no refund. The organizers and
          volunteers will be introduced at the beginning of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruby for Good organizers will be happy to help participants contact
          local or site law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
          those experiencing harassment in order for them to feel safe for the
          duration of the event. We value you and your attendance.
        </p>
