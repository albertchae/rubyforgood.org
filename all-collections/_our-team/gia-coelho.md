write_up:
  - paragraph:
      "As a product design practice lead and mentor, I focus on building teams, design practices, and products through a human-centered approach.
      Championing a multidisciplinary approach, in a design landscape that is in constant flux, driven by evolving technologies and user behaviors,
      my core principle remains steadfast: putting humans at the heart of all design decisions, with an emphasis on empathy. "
  - paragraph:
      Gia has led the design and development of several successful teams and products, working closely with cross-functional teams, including
      developers and product managers, and liaising with stakeholders and business leads. I have also contributed to several open-source projects via GitHub.
